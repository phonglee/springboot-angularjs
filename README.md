springboot-angularjs-demo
JDK 8 is required
=========================

This code is an example of how to step by step develop an application with Spring Boot and AngularJS. It includes:

 I. This project was created by Maven and configured by Spring Boot (http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/1.1.5.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#getting-started-first-application)

    1. Check out this project and run with command mvn spring-boot:run

    Or start from scratch by following steps

    1. Create a new maven project by IntelliJ

    2. Update pom.xml to build project by SpringBoot

    3. Create folder structure same as this project

    4. Run server with command: mvn spring-boot:run

 II. Persist data (Spring Data JPA, Hibernate)

 III. Make a REST service (Spring Web MVC, REST services)

 IV. Validate the inputs (Bean Validation, Hibernate Validator)

 V. View by AngularJS (AngularJS)

 VI. Upload a photo (common-fileupload)

 VII. More secure (Spring Security)

 VIII. DB Migration (Flyway)

 XX. Production-ready (Spring Boot Metrics, Health, Tracing, Remote Shell)

 X. Deploy the application ('fat' JAR file, WAR file)
